            <h2>🎯 Investment Thesis</h2>
            <p>Joe focuses on <strong>AI-native vertical software</strong> that can disrupt legacy systems of record. Key themes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"AI Wedges"</strong> — Products that capture data upstream of legacy systems (Salesforce, Guidewire, ServiceNow), using voice agents, email, or internal comms as the entry point<sup>1</sup></li>
                <li><strong>Services-Led Growth</strong> — Believes the "forward deployed engineer" is the hottest job in startups; enterprise AI requires deep implementation, not just PLG<sup>2</sup></li>
                <li><strong>Insurance modernization</strong> — Trillion-dollar industry still running on PDFs and Excel; LLMs can transform underwriting, claims, and pricing</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-border fintech</strong> — Infrastructure for default-global companies moving money internationally</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="callout">💡 <em>"Enterprises buying AI are like your grandma getting an iPhone: they want to use it, but they need you to set it up."</em></p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Pattern: <strong>AI replacing human workflows</strong> in high-complexity, high-value industries (sales, insurance, HR). Likes companies that invest in implementation/services early to build moats.</p>

            <h2>👤 Background</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>a16z Partner</strong> (Sep 2021 – present) — Fintech team</li>
                <li><strong>VP Business Development, Ethos</strong> — Scaled agent distribution channel to millions in monthly revenue; led carrier/reinsurance partnerships<sup>3</sup></li>
                <li><strong>Investor, Accel</strong> — Pre-partner VC experience</li>
                <li><strong>Notre Dame Investment Office</strong> — Buser Fellow managing endowment</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>🏈 The Football Story</h3>
            <p>Joe was a <strong>walk-on linebacker at Notre Dame</strong> who became team captain and MVP in 2014 — the first walk-on to win team MVP since 2002. Brian Kelly said: <em>"What we lacked without him was the leadership, energy, and passion needed in this game on a day-to-day basis."</em><sup>4</sup></p>
            <p>This shapes his investing lens: he appreciates scrappy founders who outwork the competition and build through grit rather than pedigree.</p>
